- This is a simulation of an 8x8 detector array of GAGG Crystals.
- Geometry:
    - 3x3x10 (mm) for the GAGG Crystals (1% Ce Doping). Reference used: https://www.epic-crystal.com/data/upload/20240409/6614a154ea168.pdf
    - 0.05 (mm) gap of TIO2 reflector
    - Source is placed 5cm away from detector array
    - Opening aperture 2 deg (aimed at centre 4 crystals)
- Information Stored:
    - Energy of incident particle gun (eTrue)
    - Crystal Info: eDep, eCompt, ePhot, eComptLoss, eBindingEnergy
    - Loss info: eLeak (magnitude and leakage face), eAbsorber
    - Initial hit point
- Structure:
    - Initial hit point coordinates and losses are using Stepping.cc (Stepping Action)
    - Crystal Info and Absorber eDep are stored using Detector.cc (Sensitive Detector). Energy of produced secondaries are tracked and stored.
- Run:
    - G4MultiThreading is enabled for faster simulation.
    - ROOT files are added to single file for analysis.
